# CODE STYLES

## NON-NEGOTIABLE CODING STYLES

 - All code MUST pass linting and not exhibit any TypeScript errors
 - Lint rules should not be disabled just to make your life easier
 - Prefer functional approach to arrays instead of looping and using Array.push
 - Infer TypeScript types
 - Use type declarations instead of inlining types
 - Always apply the `newline-before-return` rule
 - Object declarations should always be done over multiple lines
 - Use descriptive variable names
 - Do not import `React` from `react`
 - No not use `return;`, use proper control flow

## TESTING

- Write tests which test functionality, not tests that test the code

## OTHER

- Always use `yarn` and not `npm`
